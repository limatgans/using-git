## Installing GIT

### Checking GIT Version
``` git --version ```

Even if it’s already installed, it’s probably a good idea to update to the latest version.

### For Linux
If you’re on Fedora (or any closely-related RPM-based distribution, such as RHEL or CentOS), you can use dnf:

``` $ sudo dnf install git-all ```

If you’re on a Debian-based distribution, such as Ubuntu, try apt:

``` $ sudo apt install git-all```

For other distributions see [Download Git for Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)

### For Windows
Follow any one of the following steps
1. [Using Installer](https://git-scm.com/download/win) or
2. [Git For Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) or
3. [GitHub Desktop Website](https://desktop.github.com/)

### For MacOS
On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this simply by trying to run git from the Terminal the very first time.

1. [Using Installer](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) or
2. Install the Xcode Command Line Tools. or
